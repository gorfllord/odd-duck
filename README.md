## Cookie Stand

Build an app that estimates cookie sales by location and displays them in a table. Also build a webpage to display it and a parent site that explains the mission of the cookie business. The sales page can also input new entries from a form that will update the table.

### Reflections and Comments

* An important note is that I decided to get a little extra and make separate pages for the pages in the nav bar, which means I spread out some of the picture assets across multiple pages. Mostly the deviant is the T-Shirt picture which I threw just on the Merch page. Clicking the logo in the header takes you back to index.html.
